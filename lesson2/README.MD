In the lesson2 directory, there is the script that we made during the lesson for playing rock paper scissors against the computer.

Your homework for the week is:
1. Implement a scoring system where the player and the computer each have a score that gets updated after each game. The score must be printed out after each game, and a file with the score must be updated as well.
2. Add the option for a player 2, where you cannot see what each player inputs as their weapon until the winner is revealed. Add a player 2 score on the scoreboard and to the score file.
3. (Extra) Take a look at the BeautifulSoup python library (install with "pip install BeautifulSoup") and use it to scrape data from a website of your choice (Eg. weather data, price data, product data) and output the scraped results to a file in a nicely formatted way.

Do all of your work in a branch off of master ("git checkout -b azola_homework_lesson2") and push your work to that branch ("git push origin azola_homework_lesson2")

Don't hesitate to ask questions/give feedback in Slack :)
